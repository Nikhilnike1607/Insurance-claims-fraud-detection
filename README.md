# Insurance-claims-fraud-detection
This dataset has historical insurance claims and wants to build a machine learning model to predict and identify potentially fraudulent claims, thereby saving costs and improving the integrity of the insurance process. I have Utilized 8 supervised machine learning models in python to compare the accuracy of all models.
