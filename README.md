# Insurance-claims-fraud-detection
This dataset has historical insurance claims and wants to build a machine learning model to predict and identify potentially fraudulent claims, thereby saving costs and improving the integrity of the insurance process. I have Utilized 8 supervised machine learning models in python to compare the accuracy of all models. 
Supervised ML Models are used to compare:Â¶
Support Vector classifier
Decision Tree classifier
Random Forest classifier
Adaboost classifier
Gradient boosting
Stochastic Gradient Boosting
Extra Trees Classifier
VotingClassifier
