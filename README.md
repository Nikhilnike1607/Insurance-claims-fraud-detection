# Insurance-claims-fraud-detection
This dataset has historical insurance claims and wants to build a machine learning model to predict and identify potentially fraudulent claims, thereby saving costs and improving the integrity of the insurance process. I have Utilized 8 supervised machine learning models in python to compare the accuracy of all models. </br>
Supervised ML Models are used to compare: </br>
 a. Support Vector classifier </br>
 b. Decision Tree classifier </br>
 c. Random Forest classifier </br>
 d. Adaboost classifier </br>
 e. Gradient boosting </br>
 f. Stochastic Gradient Boosting </br>
 g. Extra Trees Classifier </br>
 i. VotingClassifier </br>
